## 🔍 Problem Definition

Early detection of plant leaf diseases is crucial for preventing large-scale agricultural losses.  
Manual detection is slow, inaccurate, and not scalable.  
This project uses **Computer Vision + Deep Learning** to classify plant leaves as:

- **Healthy**, or  
- **Diseased (one of multiple disease categories)**  

The model is trained on a curated image dataset and uses transfer learning for efficient classification.
